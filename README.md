# Libft
This proyect is about do your first library with functions that you will use in the future.

- First part have the functions that works with memory (mostly).
- The second part have functions that works with strings, modifiying them and using the funcntion malloc.
- At the end we have bonus part. Is these functions we works with linked list and we will learn how works and to modify them.

To this project is necessary to do a [Makefile](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/). An file that allow us to compile the functions that we create before.
